# Zanotab

TODO: write better documentation
This is a very young project, use at your own risk!

Zanotab is an extension of rich.
Rich is an incredible project and has so many cool things, and i am only scratching the surface of what it can do!
But as we do, i had a vision, and the tool was frustrating me, so i hacked something up.

# Vision

using rich.layout, we can create splits in a bspwm/tmux style. But doing so is slightly annoying in the code, and then
I remembered a tool called teamocil. I could write layouts in YAML! I want to do that in rich.

Alternatively, we could build it on-the-fly and pass it around in nested lists! Lets do both!

The more i use it, it feels kind of like css grid. This may be a way forward.

# Roadmap

[*] The nested lists thing
[ ] Loading from YAML files
